Caladin currently manages a property located in Florence, Oregon on Highway 101 near the dunes and the beach. This property has a main building and a separate studio apartment. Both are currently leased long-term. The main building is a shared dwelling with multiple renters. The studio does not have its own kitchen but all other necessities. All property tenants have full use of the laundry room, kitchen, and garage. Due to the shared nature of this property rent includes all utilities, including electricity, gas, water, and garbage. Caladin takes care of lease negotiation, collecting rent monthly, and paying all bills. Caladin also monitors utility utilization and works with tenants to limit excessive use.
