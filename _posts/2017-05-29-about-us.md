# About Us

## Caladin ITS, LLC

Caladin ITS, LLC is a holding company for several businesses.

Caladin ITS was founded in 1995 as Beta Computer Services. At the time of founding the business concentrated on providing hands-on technical assistance for the retail market. The range of computer services continued to expand as the demands of the market changed.

In 2010 Beta Computer Services became Caladin ITS when it choose the expand its management expertise into areas outside of the computer industry, starting with real estate management. Caladin ITS was formed as a holding company for the various businesses, each of which concentrates in a specific industry.

IT services were temporarily suspended while it dedicated its attention to a single firm requiring extensive assistance. Real Estate services continued during this time. As of October 2017, Caladin ITS is again providing IT services.
